/**
 * Shared rules for the employer Request Manpower flow — Developer 2 scope.
 *
 * Mirrors `lib/applicant.ts` deliberately: pure functions, no React and no Node
 * imports, so the SAME logic validates in the modal (instant feedback) and in
 * the API route (a crafted request cannot bypass it).
 *
 * ⚠️ PHASE 1: employer requests are validated and handed off by email. They are
 * NEVER written to a database or a file — that is Phase 2.
 *
 * Employers get email only, by agreement: WhatsApp is offered on the job-seeker
 * side, but employer requests are expected to arrive through the more formal
 * channel. There is intentionally no wa.me builder here.
