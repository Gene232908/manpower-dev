 * About Us page.

 * MILESTONE 2: Company Statistics, Certifications & Licences, and the Team
 * Photograph section are all removed. The Team Photograph section carries no
 * stock photography as a stand-in ("we currently do not have an official
 * company/team photograph ... please do not use stock photography as a
 * temporary replacement").
 *
 * "Trusted By" briefly stood in for those three sections and has since been
 * removed at the client's request — it was an empty partner-logo slot with
 * nothing confirmed to put in it. Partner names and logos are still awaited;
 * the Industries page carries the client-authorised temporary letter tiles.
