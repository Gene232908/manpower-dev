          Runs synchronously as the parser reaches it, which is BEFORE any
          animated element below has been parsed or painted. That ordering is
          the whole point: it prevents content rendering visible and then
          snapping to hidden once CSS applies.

          It adds the class only when reduced motion is NOT requested, so the
          motion preference is honoured before a single frame is drawn. The
          try/catch means an old browser without matchMedia simply gets the
          static site rather than an error.
