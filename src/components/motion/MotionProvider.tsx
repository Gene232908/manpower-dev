/**
 * Scroll-reveal driver — Developer 2 scope (Milestone 1: animation).
 *
 * ONE IntersectionObserver for the whole document, rather than one client
 * component per animated block. Server components stay server components and
 * simply mark themselves with `data-reveal`, so no page content has to ship as
 * client JavaScript just to fade in. This file is the only motion JS on the
 * site and it renders nothing.
 *
 * SAFETY: the hidden starting state lives behind `.motion-ready`, which the
 * boot script in layout.tsx adds before first paint and never adds when the
 * visitor prefers reduced motion. So if this component fails, is blocked, or
 * never hydrates, every element is already in its final visible state. Content
 * is never trapped behind an animation that cannot run.
