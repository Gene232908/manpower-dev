 * ⚠️ REAL QUOTES ARE STILL BLOCKED. The client's brief is explicit: "we will
 * provide genuine testimonials once available ... do not create placeholder
 * reviews." So the empty state NEVER invents one. What it can do is show the
 * card design, which is what `preview` is for: the cards render with their
 * copy visibly marked as placeholder and with no name, role or company
 * attached to anything. Nothing on screen can be read as a review a real
 * person gave — there is no person on it — while the layout, spacing and card
 * treatment are all reviewable ahead of the real quotes landing.
 *
 * The moment `content.testimonials` has entries, both empty states disappear
 * and the real quotes render. Populating the content array is the only change
 * needed; nothing here has to be touched.
