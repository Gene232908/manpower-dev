/**
 * Home page hero — frosted-glass (glassmorphism) overlay panel over the
 * background video.
 *
 * The headline, subheadline and CTA sit inside a translucent panel built on
 * `backdrop-filter: blur(...)`, a semi-transparent frost background, a thin
 * light border and a soft shadow — legible over the video regardless of what
 * is playing behind it.
 *
 * The footage itself lives in HeroVideo, which is a client component only
 * because the loop is played back fast (see the note there).
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY: `supports-[backdrop-filter]` gates the translucent look; a
 * browser without `backdrop-filter` support falls back to a solid frost
 * background on the panel, so text contrast is never at the mercy of the
 * blur rendering.

            TWO LINES, ALWAYS — "Bringing Great People" / "to Great
            Businesses." The break is client-specified, so it is set in the
            content layer (`headlineLines`) and each line is `whitespace-nowrap`
            rather than left to wrap wherever the column happens to run out.

            Sizing is `cqw`, not a breakpoint ladder: 1cqw is 1% of the PANEL's
            content box, so the type scales with the box that has to hold it.
            That is what makes the two-line promise hold at any width AND at
            any browser zoom — zoom changes the CSS pixel width of the panel,
            the font size follows it, and the ratio between the two never
            moves. A breakpoint ladder cannot do this: it steps at fixed
            viewport widths and says nothing about the widths in between,
            which is exactly where the third line used to appear.

            8.2cqw is measured, not guessed — it is the largest ratio at which
            the longer of the two lines still clears the panel's content box
            with margin to spare. The clamp floor keeps the headline readable
            in a very narrow panel; the ceiling stops it outgrowing the
            supporting copy on a wide desktop.

            The space between the lines is a REAL text node, not decoration.
            Two adjacent block spans concatenate with nothing between them, so
            the heading's text content came out as "Bringing Great Peopleto
            Great Businesses." — which is what a screen reader announces, what
            a search engine indexes, and what lands on the clipboard. The
            space collapses to nothing visually at the start of a block line,
            so it costs no layout and fixes all three.
